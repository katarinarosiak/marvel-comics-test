# marvel-comics-task describtion
The Marvel Comics Test is a simple React application displaying characters from Iron Man's random story.

Each time the windows is refreshed in the browser the application will perform several sequential queries to get data about the favourite character, a random story and featured characters in that story. 

The page displays:

* The titile of the story
* The story's description
* A list of names and pictures of the characters that features in the story
* A description for each character
* The Marvel attribution text

# Additional remarks:

- Some of the stories doesn't contain a description. For it to be more clear I have added an alternative text in a description place ("This story doesn't have a description")
- Some story titles looks more like a desciption than an actual title 
- For the visual purpose I added a description for each character 


# Specification:

The Comics Test
Your task is to generate an HTML page that lists the characters from a
Marvel-story.
Using the Marvel API [http://developer.marvel.com/docs], pick a random story
featuring your favourite character (perhaps The Hulk?). Generate an HTML page
with the following characteristics:
* The story's description
* A list of names and pictures of the characters that features in the story
* The Marvel attribution text
We are not too fussy about the layout or design of the generated HTML
page, but the HTML itself should be well-formatted.
You should supply instructions on how to install and run your project.
The result of your test should be delivered on a repository on Github, Bitbucket or similar.
