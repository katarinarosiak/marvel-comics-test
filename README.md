# marvel-comics-task describtion

Specification: 
The Comics Test
Your task is to generate an HTML page that lists the characters from a
Marvel-story.
Using the Marvel API [http://developer.marvel.com/docs], pick a random story
featuring your favourite character (perhaps The Hulk?). Generate an HTML page
with the following characteristics:
* The story's description
* A list of names and pictures of the characters that features in the story
* The Marvel attribution text
We are not too fussy about the layout or design of the generated HTML
page, but the HTML itself should be well-formatted.
You should supply instructions on how to install and run your project.
The result of your test should be delivered on a repository on Github, Bitbucket or similar.
